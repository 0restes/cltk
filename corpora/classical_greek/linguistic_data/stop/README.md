This list of stop words has been moved over from the now-defunct [Latin\_and\_Ancient\_Greek\_for\_NLTK](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/Latin_and_Ancient_Greek_for_NLTK/tree/master/stop), though its original source was the [Perseus Hopper source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/perseus-hopper), found at "/sgml/reading/build/stoplists". Perseus source is made available under the [Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL 1.1)](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/1.1/).

The original file was that found in stops\_beta\_code\_lower.txt, which I have transformed into uppercase and Unicode. Note that the Unicode lists do not use the word-final sigma ('Ï‚') and have, if applicable, acute accents.

TODO: See what 'ga^' is supposed to be on line 28 of the original Perseus file.
