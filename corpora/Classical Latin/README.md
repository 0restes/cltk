There are multiple, overlapping libraries for Latin language support.

    The Packard Humanities Index (PHI), disc #5, is the most comprehensive collection of Classical Latin. It was originally distributed on a CD. Some of the contents of the collection are copyrighted, so you must comile these yourself, using either the corpus compiler (available through <code>from cltk.compiler import Compile</code>). The contents of this disc are also [available online](http://latin.packhum.org/) and downloadable through [this crawler](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/phi5_crawler).

    The 7th PHI disc contains non-literary, documentary Greek and Latin sources. To compile this, see the cltk's Compiler.

    The Latin Library is chronologically expansive, containing an array of texts from Archaic to Neoclassical Latin. The collection available here was imported from the deprecated [Latin Library Toolkit](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/latin_language_toolkit). Everything in the Latin Library is in the public domain.
