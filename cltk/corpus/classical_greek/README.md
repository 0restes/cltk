TODO for replacer.py
--------------------

Errors have been found with the following Beta Code translations:

  - ~~"\*)A", "Ἀ"  (eg, "\*)AQHNAI=OI", "*)αθηναῖοι")~~
  - ~~":", "·" (eg, "R(A/|DION:", "ῥᾴδιον:")~~
  - As with the first todo item, add the Perseus-style conversions for all headword characters
