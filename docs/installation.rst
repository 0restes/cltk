Installation
************

Through Pip
===========

You'll need a working installation of Python 3.3 with [Pip installed alongside Python 3.3](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html),

First, you'll need [the alpha version of the NLTK](http://nltk.org/nltk3-alpha/)::

   pip install http://nltk.org/nltk3-alpha/nltk-3.0a3.tar.gz

The CLTK is [available at PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cltk), which means that it may be installed with the following::

   pip install cltk

By source
======

[The source is available at GitHub](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/cltk). To build from source, run within the root directory::

   python setup.py sdist install
