Welcome to Classical Language Toolkit's documentation
=====================================================

The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) offers natural language processing support for Classical languages. In some areas, it extends the NLTK. The goals of the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) are to:

* Compile analysis-friendly corpora in a variety of Classical languages (Greek and Latin are in progress, with more in the pipeline).

* Gather, improve, and generate linguistic data required for NLP.

* Develop a free and open platform for generating reproducible, scientific research that advances the study of the literature and languages of the ancient world.
