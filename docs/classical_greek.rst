Classical Greek

Text Processing
===============

Convert Beta Code to Unicode
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from cltk.corpus.classical_greek.replacer import Replacer

   BETA_EXAMPLE = r"""O(/PWS OU)=N MH\ TAU)TO\ PA/QWMEN E)KEI/NOIS, E)PI\ TH\N DIA/GNWSIN AU)TW=N E)/RXESQAI DEI= PRW=TON.

   MY_REPLACER = Replacer()
   unicode_converted = MY_REPLACER.beta_code(BETA_EXAMPLE)

   print(unicode_converted)

Filter Stopwords
----------------

.. code-block:: python

   import nltk.tokenize
   from cltk.stop.classical_greek.stops_unicode import STOPS_LIST

   SENTENCE = """
   Ἅρπαγος δὲ καταστρεψάμενος Ἰωνίην ἐποιέετο στρατηίην ἐπὶ Κᾶρας καὶ Καυνίους καὶ Λυκίους, ἅμα ἀγόμενος καὶ Ἴωνας καὶ Αἰολέας.
   """

   lowered = SENTENCE.lower()
   tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(lowered)
   filtered = [w for w in tokens if not w in STOPS_LIST]

   print(filtered)


TLG
===

Compile into files
------------------

In order for the CLTK to work with the TLG, its files first need to be translated from its legacy encoding into Unicode. To do this, first put the TLG_E/ directory into the local/ directory, at the root of the CLTK repository. Next, from within the root of the directory, open a Python shell::

 .. code-block:: bash

    $ python

and then::

   .. code-block:: python

      from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

      c = Compile()

      c.dump_txts_tlg_files()

Following this, you should see a screen printout of each TLG file as it is being transformed into Unicode and where it is being saved (e.g., ``/Users/kyle/cltk/cltk/corpus/classical_greek/plaintext/tlg_e/TLG5033.txt``).

A few things to note: Your TLG directory must be named ``TLG_E`` and the TLG's file names must be all uppercase (e.g., ``TLG0020.TXT``).

Compile into JSON
-----------------

.. code-block:: python

   from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

   c = Compile()

   c.dump_txts_tlg()

The CLTK compiler can also output the entirety of the TLG into a single JSON object. Outputting this into one file is probably inadvisable, since it would be too large for efficient reading, but this code would only need a little modification to insert into a document-oriented database, such as MongoDB.

Compile Author-File and Author-Works Indices
--------------------------------------------

The CLTK comes with pre-compiled author-file and author-work indices for the TLG (``authtab.txt`` and ``auth_work.txt``, respectively). They can be found at ``cltk/corpus/classical_greek/plaintext/tlg_e/``. The former is a dictionary listing of TLG file names and abbreviated author names (e.g, ``'TLG2474': 'Nicander Hist.'``). The latter, ``auth_work.txt``, is a large dictionary containing metadata about authors and their writings (at  ``cltk/corpus/classical_greek/plaintext/tlg_e/auth_work.txt``).

To re-compile these yourself, the following two methods may be used. To create ``authtab.txt``:

.. code-block:: python

   from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

   c = Compile()

   c.dump_txts_tlg()

And to re-compile ``auth_work.txt``, do:

.. code-block:: python

   from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

   c.make_authtab()

   c.write_tlg_auth_works()


.. note::

   The TLG and PHI7 both come with index files (e.g., ``BIBINDCD.BIN``, ``LIST4CLA.BIN``), though these have proven challenging to parse.


PHI7
====

Compile into Files
------------------

.. note::

   The PHI7 is compiled but its Beta Code is not currently converted into Unicode. For this to be done, a little parser for Greek markup needs to be written.

The PHI7 may also be generated in a way similar to the TLG, only with ``c.dump_txts_phi7_files()`` (or ``c.dump_txts_phi7()``).::

   from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

   c = Compile('/home/kyle/Downloads/project_dir/corps', '/home/kyle/cltk/cltk/corpus')

   c.dump_txts_phi7_files()
   
write_phi7_auth_works()
