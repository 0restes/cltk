Convert Beta Code to Unicode
----------------------------

::

   from cltk.corpus.classical_greek.replacer import Replacer

   BETA_EXAMPLE = r"""O(/PWS OU)=N MH\ TAU)TO\ PA/QWMEN E)KEI/NOIS, E)PI\ TH\N DIA/GNWSIN AU)TW=N E)/RXESQAI DEI= PRW=TON.

   MY_REPLACER = Replacer()
   unicode_converted = MY_REPLACER.beta_code(BETA_EXAMPLE)

   print(unicode_converted)

Compile TLG
-----------

In order for the CLTK to work with the TLG, its files first need to be translated from its legacy encoding into Unicode. To do this, first put the TLG_E/ directory into the local/ directory, at the root of the CLTK repository. Next, from within the root of the directory, open a Python shell::

 .. code-block:: bash

    $ python

and then::

   .. code-block:: python

      from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

      c = Compile()

      c.dump_txts_tlg_files()

Following this, you should see a screen printout of each TLG file as it is being transformed into Unicode and where it is being saved (e.g., ``/Users/kyle/cltk/cltk/corpus/classical_greek/plaintext/tlg_e/TLG5033.txt``).

A few things to note: Your TLG directory must be named ``TLG_E`` and the TLG's file names must be all uppercase (e.g., ``TLG0020.TXT``).

The CLTK compiler can also output the entirety of the TLG into a single JSON object. Outputting this into one file (with ``c.dump_txts_tlg()``) is probably inadvisable, since it would be too large for efficient reading, but this code would only need a little modification to insert into a `document-oriented database <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database>`_ (such as MongoDB).

Compile PHI7
-----------

The PHI7 may also be generated in a way similar to the TLG, only with ``c.dump_txts_phi7_files()`` (or ``c.dump_txts_phi7()``).::

   from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

   c = Compile('/home/kyle/Downloads/project_dir/corps', '/home/kyle/cltk/cltk/corpus')

   c.dump_txts_phi7_files()

Compile Author-Works Indices
----------------------------

.. important::

   Versions of these auth_work.txt files come with the CLTK, though they do not catch every title within every file. This is due to some inconsistent markup within the original corpora. There remains to be written and tested additional regular expressions to catch all titles.

.. note::

   The TLG and PHI7 both come with index files (e.g., ``BIBINDCD.BIN``, ``LIST4CLA.BIN``), though these have proven difficult for the author of the CLTK to parse. Any assistance in this realm is heartily encouraged.

After the TLG and PHI7 corpora have been compiled by the CLTK, it can generate indices for the works contained within each author file. Essentially, it looks in each author's file (e.g., ``TLG0020.txt``) and scans its contents looking for title tags (i.e., ``{1ΑΔΡΑΣΤΟΣ}1``).

After the CLTK generates an author-work index, a file called ``auth_work.txt`` will be added to the respective directories (i.e., ``cltk/corpus/classical_greek/plaintext/tlg_e/auth_work.txt``, ``cltk/corpus/classical_greek/plaintext/tlg_e/auth_work.txt``). To generate for the TLG::

   from cltk.corpus.common.compiler import Compile

   c = Compile('/home/kyle/Downloads/project_dir/corps', '/home/kyle/cltk/cltk/corpus')

   c.write_tlg_auth_works()

And for the PHI7, replace the final command with ``write_phi7_auth_works()``.


Filter Stopwords
----------------

::

   import nltk.tokenize
   from cltk.stop.classical_greek.stops_unicode import STOPS_LIST

   SENTENCE = """
   Ἅρπαγος δὲ καταστρεψάμενος Ἰωνίην ἐποιέετο στρατηίην ἐπὶ Κᾶρας καὶ Καυνίους καὶ Λυκίους, ἅμα ἀγόμενος καὶ Ἴωνας καὶ Αἰολέας.
   """

   lowered = SENTENCE.lower()
   tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(lowered)
   filtered = [w for w in tokens if not w in STOPS_LIST]

   print(filtered)
